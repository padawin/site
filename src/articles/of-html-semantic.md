## Of HTML semantic...

- &lt;a&gt; tags are links, with them, the users go somewhere.
- &lt;button&gt; tags are button, they do something (and may go somewhere after a form submit).
- Each must look like what they are meant to be. And each must be used as they are meant to. The user must know what behaviour to expect on an application.
