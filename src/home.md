## About me

<p>
My name is Ghislain Rodrigues, I am a positive, empathetic and passionate developer who loves to solve problems and constantly seeks new topics to learn and understand. I see programming as a craft, and I care about doing it well.
</p>
<p>
Over the course of my personal and professional career, I have worked with diverse languages (such as Golang, Python, C, C++...) and value the variety of approached knowing different technologies bring.
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, writing good quality software, in an elegant and maintainable way is part of my role and a mandatory step in order to complete a task.
</p>
<p>
I work with the motto of "leave the place in a better state than how you found it".
</p>
<p>
Team work is important for me, I work better in collaboration with people, building things together, through discussions, pair programming and code reviews. I am an approachable person and always welcome questions, it is important for me that my coworkers feel that they can be vulnerable with me.
</p>
<p>
As a user, I also believe in accessibility and simplicity. It is important for me to build well made, friendly products for users.
</p>
<p>
I am also passionate about Git, care about using the good workflow for a given need, very happily give presentations about it, help my teammates understand the tool better and can talk for hours about it!
</p>
<p>
I am a nerd.

When I don't code, I like (among other things) to:
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://travels.ghislain-rodrigues.fr">travel and take photos</a></li>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://recipes.ghislain-rodrigues.fr">cook</a></li>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.librarything.com/catalog/padawin_ghis/yourlibrary">read</a> (and book <a href="quotes.html">quotes</a>)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
For me, sharing information is invaluable and I am always happy to share what
I know and learn from people. At work, I regularly give workshops on advanced
features of Git, or about various programming topics. You can find my slides
