<blockquote>
There is one emotion that patriarchy values when expressed by men; that emotion
is anger. Real men get mad. And their mad-ness,  no matter how violent or
violating, is deemed natural — a positive expression of patriarchal masculinity.

Ultimately the menu will choose against violence, against death, do so because

remember.

Death and the Dervish, Meša Selimović

<hr />

<blockquote>
The river resembles me: sometimes turbulent and foaming, more often calm and
inaudible. I was sorry when the dammed it up below the tekke and diverted it
inro a trench to make it obedient and useful, so it would run through a mill
wheel. And I was happy when it swelled, destroyed the dam, and flowed free. I
knew all the while that only tamed waters can mill wheat.

<blockquote>
See, Artyom, you obviously come from a station where the clock works and you all
look at it in awe, comparing the time on your wrist watch to the red numbers
above the tunnel entrance. For you, time is the same for everyone, just like
light. Well, here it's the opposite: nothing is anyone else's business. No one
is obliged to make sure there's light for all the people who have made their way
here.  Go up to anybody here and suggest just that and it will seem absurd to
them. Whoever needs light has to bring it here with them. It's the same with
time: whoever needs to know the time, whoever is afraid of chaos, needs to bring
their own time with them. Everyone keeps some time here. Their own time.  And
it's different for everybody and it depends on their calculations, but they're
all equally right, and each person believes in their own time, and subordinates
their life to its rhythms. For me it's evening right now, for you it's morning -
and what? People like you are so careful about storing up the hours you spend
wandering, just as ancient peoples kept pieces of glowing coal in smouldering
crucibles, hoping to resurrect fire from them. But there are others who lost
their piece of coal, maybe even threw it away. You know, in the metro, it is
basically always night-time and it makes no sense to keep track of time here so
painstakingly. Explode your hours and you'll see how time will transform - it's
very interesting. It changes - you won't even recognize it. It will cease to be
fragmented, broken into the sections of hours, minutes and seconds. Time is like
mercury: scatter it and it will grow together again, it will again find its own
integrity and indeterminacy. People tamed it, shackled it into pocket-watches
and stop-watches - and for those that hold time on a chain, time flows evenly.
But try to free it and you will see: it flows differently for different people,
for some it is slow and viscous, counted in the inhalations and exhalations of
smoked cigarettes, for others it races along, and they can only measure it in
past lives. You think it's morning now? There is a great likelihood that you are
right: there's a roughly twenty five percent likelihood.  Nevertheless, this
morning of yours has no sense to it, since it's up there on the surface and
there's no life up there anymore. Well, there're no more people, anyway.  Does
what occurs above have value for those who never go there? No. So when I say
“good evening” to you, if you like, you can answer “good morning.” There's no
time in this station, except perhaps one and it's very strange: now it is the
four hundred and nineteenth day and I'm counting backwards.

<blockquote>
He needs water,
the one who has just arrived,
dry clothes, and a warm welcome
from a friendly host —
and if he can get it,
a chance to listen and be listen to.

The Wanderer's Hávamál, Translated by Jackson Crawford

<hr />

<blockquote>
Try to choose carefully, Arren, when the great choices must be made. When I was
young, I had to choose between the life of being and the life of doing. And I
leapt at the latter like a trout to a fly. But each deed you do, each act, binds
you to itself and to its consequences, and makes you act again and yet again.
Then very seldom do you come upon a space, a time like this, between act and
act, when you may stop and simply be. Or wonder who, after all, you are

It’s none of their business, where you are, or who you are, or what you
choose to do or not to do! If they come prying they can leave curious.

<blockquote>
- She's my best friend, Sam said.<br/>
- Sure, Max said, I get that. But is it, you know—I hope this isn't weird that
I'm asking this—is it romantic? Or has it ever been romantic?<br/>
- No, Sam said. We've never... It's more than romantic. It's better than
romance. It's friendship.

<blockquote>
Sam knew the foot was gone. He could see it was gone. He knew that what he was
experiencing was a basic error in programming, and he wished he could open up
his brain and delete the bad code. Unfortunately, the human brain is very bit as
closed a system as a Mac.

Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, by Gabrielle Zevin

<blockquote>
Live all you can; it’s a mistake not to. It doesn’t so much matter what you do in particular, so long as you have your life. If you haven’t had that what have you had? What one loses one loses; make no mistake about that. [...] Still, one has the illusion of freedom; therefore don’t be, like me, without the memory of that illusion. I was either, at the right time, too stupid or too intelligent to have it; I don’t quite know which. Of course at present I’m a case of reaction against the mistake; and the voice of reaction should, no doubt, always be taken with an allowance. But that doesn’t affect the point that the right time is now yours. The right time is any time that one is still so lucky as to have. You’ve plenty; that’s the great thing; you’re, as I say, damn you, so happily and hatefully young. Don’t at any rate miss things out of stupidity. Of course I don’t take you for a fool, or I shouldn’t be addressing you thus awfully. Do what you like so long as you don’t make my mistake. For it was a mistake. Live!
