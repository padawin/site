Welcome here,<br />
My name is Ghislain Rodrigues, programmer based in London. I love to code, it is my job, but a hobby too.<br />
You can find most of my projects on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/padawin">Github</a>.<br />
You can also find me on <a target="_blank" href="https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/ghislain-rodrigues/45/68a/322">Linkedin</a>.<br />
When I am not coding, I like (among other things) to <a target="_blank" href="http://travels.ghislain-rodrigues.fr">travel and take pictures</a>.
